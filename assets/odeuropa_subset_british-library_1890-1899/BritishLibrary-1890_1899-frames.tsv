It was hot even here , although the glass was covered by an awning through the day , but it was sultry everywhere in the early days of June .

bl08001	scent	of the gardenias	heavy								The dim lamp had struggled with the breaking day , and a garish light burst in on the midnight scene .	Still rose the heavy scent of the gardenias from the bouquet she had worn one night ago ; but the faded heliotrope seemed to wither without the water spilt upon the floor .	About them lay the broken glass of the photo frame , and the portrait pushed aside .
bl08001	liqueurs	coffees									Down on the full tide , with its gentle ripple , that lapped against the Palace walls , gleamed the bright lamps here and there , while in the darkened sky above the stars were glittering , and the moon shone bright on the throng of England ' s chosen .	Here and there the people chattered , and the waiters hurried to and fro with coffees and liqueurs .	In open doorways the whips , known without their hats , still lounged , and around was the perfume of the ' plants ' mixing with that of blossoms worn by the grave and fair .

In open doorways the whips , known without their hats , still lounged , and around was the perfume of the ' plants ' mixing with that of blossoms worn by the grave and fair .

' I wanted to bring you something like yourself , ' he muttered ; ' deep tone , sweet perfume , harmonious sight .	Ah ! He leaned back and looked all round him , noting every httle detail — the amber cushions on the couches , the white fur rags on the dark - stained floor , the landscape here and there on the yellow walls , the narrow lattice window flung ajar , and the dark green fern bending beneath the August sun .

Katherine leaned back , laughing with all the gaiety of her buoyant heart , while the scent of the fragrant Manillas filled the surrounding surrounding air .	CHAPTER XIII Katherine ' s face was pressed against the grating of the Ladies ' Cage in the House of Commons , and with two ungloved hands she clung to the iron bar in front .

It was so much pleasanter for them , sitting on a stool , drawing threads through a machine , the fluff of which was as good as snuff to their nostrils , than to do odd jobs in the open air or in the rooms at home .	It added so much to their importance and well - being to bring grist to the paternal mill , of which they had no part or parcel , but were merely apprentices , many years too young , with the hours of seance childhood sacrificed of these poor beings thrust upon the soil .

A thin , narrow , slender woman , with soiled black gown and ruffled , death - scented hair .	Her eyes , shrunken and pale , were the tint of her shrivelled skin , while the lids stood out , red , swollen and inflamed , burnt with an inward agony , not with tear - drops that bring intense relief .

At her feet lay the bouquet of gardenias , shrivelled , but emitting an intoxicating perfume , while , her gloves wrung off , she trifled with the diamonds on her nervous , long , thin fingers .	Like a very Nana , she smiled in the glass , and her eyes , black in their depths , flashed back on herself .
bl08001	fragrant|fragrant	rose	fragrant|fragrant								Could great fights only be won like this , with the blood of brains , with the weight of human sighs ? Another moment , and she laughed .	A creamy , fragrant rose lay on the stone pillar , its long stem had clambered up , and its green leaves lay beside .	' John was coming that night ; well , it didn ' t matter ! He knew the Labour question was first , and he did not know how widely they diverged on it .
bl08001	smell	of them injens									John James was yarning on , — ' And he drew me aside in a confidential way so that I grew quite alarmed , and began to think the celebrated room had been blown up with dynamite dynamite or something , but he said , Please , sir , we can ' t show it to no ladies to - day .	Fact is , we ' re jist ' avin ' an ' ot pot , and the smell of them injens is something orful ! : ' D ' vision ! ' came like the crack of doom through the night air , and in three seconds the men had vanished , and there was stillness and solitude by the waterside .	Only here and there a man — a guest looking miserably out of place — was left among the women , and under the lamps the sentry tramped up and down .

I gave a love — ' She paused , laid down her pen , and smiled , as she looked round her little room and scented the mass of mauve heliotrope beside her .

bl08001	scented|scented		flower|scented|scented				She				Mr Leighton had left her as she had bidden him , to seek the information for which they hungered .	She was glad to rest alone a moment in that flower - scented , artistic , gaily - peopled hall .	She had her mental society garb on , and , with excitement , was just a little overstrained .
bl08001	breezes		pungent								They sauntered out , Charlie lighting a cigarette for Katherine , as Tony helped himself to the cigars .	It was a fresh , cool night after the burning August day , and light , pungent breezes came over the gorse - covered plain .	Above shone the stars in the clear , dark sky , the only guide they had on the country road by the far - stretching heath .
bl08001	scent	of summer jasmine	Sweeter					after sunset			' They were only trivial sentences , but the lovelight danced in Katherine ' s eyes as she stood by .

bl08001	scented|scented	coffee	strongly - scented|scented								But they made way for her , half civilly , half indifferently , and her mission was soon done .	Springing away from the board covered with large cups of dark , strongly - scented coffee , and edging her way between great frieze - covered elbows and huge shoulders , owned by corduroy - clad men , she proceeded proceeded back more rapidly than she had come .	The streaks of light had widened , and the way , with its slippery gutters , was not so dangerous .

' ' I know it is the only way by which people can be together and respectable , which word is supposed to have a godlike savour , though it smells to me somewhat earthy , ' said Katherine , contemptuously ; ' but we are too blind to the want of respectability in people who make each other ' s lives miserable , and probably hate each other , being tied together by the closest and most coercive bond .

No palms or ferns encouraged creeping things , or stood like bazaar articles on old barrels draped in Eastern rags ; but one or two towering lilies mixed their fragrance with that of the moss - hidden violets in a gigantic bowl , which gave a perfume almost too heavy save for the breezes that came through the open - latticed window .	In the midst of this sat the woman — always the woman , no matter who else was by — a part of it , the picture in its frame .
bl08001	scented|scented	April	sweet|scented|scented	air							It was late in the afternoon , when the sun had done its work and the evening breeze made the water ripple and the timid poplars sway .	Looking out on this beauty , drinking in the sweet - scented April air , sat a young woman at an upper , small - paned window .	The room she sat in , though not large , was cool , refreshing , exquisite to the eye .
bl08001	breath|scent	of poppy|of the pink and golden honeysuckle	fading|richer	with the autumn							The burning sun had gone ; it was the late afternoon , before the shades of even .	The dust on the dark green hedgerows had a paler tinge , and a great hush crept over the grainladen grainladen fields , while with the autumn dews came the fading breath of poppy , and the richer scent of the pink and golden honeysuckle that clambered near them across the long grass - grown ditch .	The August evening seemed filled with peace , and Katherine gazed , as in a dream , on the mere wild blossoms in her lap .

In the early evening the fragrant smoke of the incense arises from the door - shrines ; each place of business has its lantern hanging at the door inscribed with the name of the shop , while in the middle of the street , above the heads of the passers - by , is hung a peanut - oil lamp .	In most of the open shops this oil has given way to American or Russian kerosene .

bl08003	odour	of hay or oats	stray	the wind			to their wide nostrils				They reached at last the ascent from the parish road to Castle Warlock .	This was so steep that their conductors , though they held no conference on the subject , were both anxious as to the behaviour of the horses ; but the moment their heads came round , whether only that it w * as another turn with its fresh hope , or that the wind brought some stray odour of hay or oats to their wide nostrils , I cannot tell , but finding the ground tolerably clear , they took the brae with a wiU , and tore up with the last efforts of a strength all but exhausted , Cosmo and Aggie running beside them , and talking to them all the way .	The only difficulty was to make the lad on the box give them head enough .
bl08003	smelling	of earth and decaying wood		the cold , damp air							A wooden chair stood in the middle of the room , and on it a bottle and teacup ; not another article was visible .

Now and then he was met by a strong scent , as of burning leather , from the oakbark oakbark which , after its astringent power had been exhausted in the tanpit some of the housewives used for fuel ; but mostly the air was filled with the odour of burning peat .	He knew almost everybody , and was kindly greeted as he went along — nor the less that some of them , when they heard he was not at school the day before , had remarked that his birthday hardly brought him enough to keep it with .
bl08003	scent|nostrils	of the flowers					he|his|his				The sky was a region of endless hopes and ever recurrent recurrent despairs ; that the beloved earthly thing should rise there , gave him one homely fact concerning the unknown and appalling .	But from the sky he was sent back to the earth in yet farther pursuit ; for whence came the rain , as his books told him , but from the sea ? The sea he had read of , though never yet beheld , and he knew it magnificent ; gladly , as he thought with himself under the wall , would he have hailed it an intermediate betwixt the sky and the earth , with the sky coming first , but , alas , the sea was before the sky in the order of the stream ' s genesis 1 And then , worse and worse ! how was the ocean fed but from the torrent ? How was the sky fed but from the ocean ? How was the dark fountain fed but from the sky ? How was the torrent fed but from the fountain ? As he sat in the hot garden , leaning against the old gray castle , the nest of his family for countless generations , with the scent of the flowers in his nostrils , and the sound of the bees in his ears , he became aware that he had lost the stream of his childhood — the mysterious , infinite idea of endless , inexplicable , original birth , of outflowing because of essential essential existence within .	There was no production any more , nothing but the merest rushing around , like the ring - sea of Saturn , in a never ending circle of formal change ! Like a great dish , the mighty ocean was skimmed in particles invisible ; these were gathered aloft into sponges all water and no sponge ; and thence through many an airy , many an earthly channel , deflowered of its mystery , his ancient , self - producing fountain to a holy , merry river , was fed — only fed I It was but a cistern after all ! He grew very sad , and well he might .
bl08003	snuff|smelt	a few|of something|of opium									There were three of them , each forming a small box .	In the first were a few grains of snuff , in the second a little of something that looked like gold dust , and the third smelt of opium .	The top of the cane had a cap of silver , with a screw ; this went into the lower part of the horse , and made of it a crutch - handle to the stick .

The scents of the flowers about his feet came borne on the eddies of the air , and paid my lord many a visit in the ante - chamber , his brain ; the windy noises of the insects , the watery noises of the pigeons , the family noises from the poultry - yard , the rushing song of the mountain mountain river , all visited him through the portals of his ears ; but at the moment the boy seemed lost , not in thought as was the fact , but in the fundamental enjoyment of mere existence .

Truth and Scotland forgive ' me , for I know none so good ? And after dinner — immediately , for the laird had long ago given up his toddy — they went to the drawingroom , drawingroom , an altogether pleasant place now in the summer .	It was full of the scent of the homely flowers Grizzie had stuck in the old vases on the chimney - piece , and their scent harmonized strangely with the slow - vanishing colours of the room .	The laird laid himself himself down on the brocade - covered sofa , and Cosmo sat close beside him on a low chair , and talked , and told him this and that , and read to him , till at last the old man fell asleep , and then Cosmo , having softly spread a covering over him , sat brooding upon things sad yet pleasant , until he too fell asleep , and went to Joan in his dreams .
bl08003	odours		evanescent								He had never save in his dreams felt the radiance of beauty ; and never a dream had shone like the reality that now folded him in bliss .	For isolating winter stretched miles and miles around the old paradise of his mother ' s drawing - room , where , in the glowing twilight of a flamy fire , whose shadows flickered at their wild will over all the magic room , he sat at the feet of a lady , with eyes black as night , but alive with a radiance no sun could kindle , with a hand like warm snow , in garments lovely as the clouds that clothe a sunset , who inhabited an atmosphere of evanescent odours , each a dream from beyond the stars , while the darkness that danced with the firelight played endless variations on the theme of her beauty .	Long had he sat lost in the dream - haunted gorgeous silence , when suddenly he bethought himself of his duty towards his heavenly visitant .

Even then , however , you might , to be sure , most likely smell the perfume — to some nostrils it is nothing less than perfume — of a peat fire , although you might be long in finding out whence it came ; for the houses , if indeed the dwellings dwellings could be called houses , were often so difficult to distinguish from the ground on which they were built , that except the smoke of fresh peats were coming pretty freely from the wide - mouthed chimney , it required an experienced eye to discover the human nest .

He was red - faced and blear - eyed , and his nose , partly from the snuff ' he took in large quantity , was much injured in shape and colour : closer description the historical muse declines .	His eyes had once been blue , but tobacco , potations , revellings day and night — everything but tears , had washed from them the most of their colour .

I stood in silent delight inhaling the fragrance and enjoying enjoying the beauty of this oasis in the desert , totally unconscious unconscious of the enchanter whose spell had awoke such floral harmonies in rude undigested Gotham .	But had I again visited the spot at the shut of some July eve or the following morning about sweet hour of there might have been discovered through the bosky vistas a spare gigantic figure passing leisurely along the walks , caressing here a drooping rose and dropping benediction there over a crushed lily , conspicuous conspicuous by his his ruddy cheeks , his long beard , white as snow , and bearing on his ample bosom the never - failing red breast - pin — his only ornament ; and under this guise might have been recognized a form not unlike that of Scotland ' s well - beloved poet — Hew Ainslie .
bl08005	scent	of a city					those				The spirits with which our three representatives of immortal immortal mendicity , Edie Ochiltree , Jinglin Jock , and the Lang Linker , bad adieu to Edina , Scotia ' s darling seat , A PILGRIMAGE TO THE LAND OF BURNS .	12 can only be rightly appreciated by those whose senses have been long familiarised to the smoke , sound , and scent of a city , but to which their spirits stubbornly refuse ever to naturalise , from an inborn love of Nature , or perhaps perhaps from the circumstance of having spent their most susceptible days where Wild woods grow and rivers row , Wi ' mony a hill The general appearance which our pilgrims exhibited , both as to equipage and equipment , on the 23rd June , 1820 , as at daybreak they bore away into the high road that leads to Lanark , though it had little in common with the dashing of modern tourists , seemed to a considerable extent to wear the uniform of their purpose .	Their vehicle , vehicle , a machine of the curricle family , more notable for its capacity and convenience than for the flourish of its trappings or the freshness of its fancy , was kept rapidly and steadily in motion by a noble aiver that had frequently , frequently , with more lumber behind him , run fifty miles beneath one sun .

After they had gazed for some time on the inanimate trunk of the long lad , John proposed that means should be instantly resorted to for his restoration , and drawing forth his ram ' s horn , spoke of effecting it by a snuff ; so , catching most dexterously the exact moment when the Linker ' s lungs were at the extreme ebb of respiration , he applied to his nose a large quantity of very dry macuba , when suddenly , with a sweep and current , it went snoring up like dust in a whirlwind , and almost instantaneously , or in the relationship of the flash of a pistol to its report , the Linker awoke with a sneeze that made the riggin ' On arriving at his average state of sensibility he nevertheless nevertheless continued to speak to his companions like a gifted man , protesting he had been in a trance and in a vision .

But who is to blame for either ?

When you land here — which you can accomplish accomplish only when the sea is calm — you find yourself in a narrow , mean , muddy street , filled with freighted camels , Iiamals , and burros , through which you are marched for a quarter of a mile before you come to a road wide enough to hold a carriage ; then you look across the street , see Howard ' s Hotel , dismiss the carriage for which you have paid a tourist agency a dollar , and walk to your stopping place .

A dark store - room opens out of it , and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I don ' t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea - chests , when there is nobody in there with a dimlyburning dimlyburning light , letting a mouldy air come out at the door , in which there is the smell of so ip , pickles , pepper , candles , and coffee , all at one whiff .	Then there are the two parlors : the parlor in which we sit of an evening , my mother and I and Peggotty — for Peggotty is quite our companion , when her work is done and we are alone — and the best parlor where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly , but not so comfortably .

Iu the meantime , I put myself on a short allowance of bear ' s grease , wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water , and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice , as being too luxurious for my stern career .	Not satisfied with all these proceedings , but burning with impatience to do something something more , I went to see Traddles , now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street , Holborn .

How somebody , lying in my bed , lay saying and doing this all over again , at cross purposes , in a feverish dream all night — the bed a rocking sea that was never still ! How , as that somebody slowly settled down into myself , did I begin to parch , and feel as if my outer covering of skin were a hard board ; my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle , furred with long service , and burning up over a slow fire ; the palms of my hands , hot plates of metal which no ice could cool ! But the agony of mind , the remorse , and shame I felt , when I became conscious next day ! My horror of having committed a thousand offences I had forgotten , and which nothing could ever expiate — my recollection of that indelible look which Agnes had given me — the torturing impossibility of communicating with her , not knowing , Beast that I was , how she came to be in London , or where she stayed — my disgust of the very sight of the room where the revel had been held — my racking head — the smell of smoke , the sight of glasses , the impossibility of going out , or even getting up 1 Oh , what a day it was !

bl08055	smell	of damp earth|wet leaves and briar									I stood in a window , and looked across theancieut street at the opposite houses , recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons , when I first came there ; and how I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows , and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs , while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens , and the dull rain fell in slanting lines , and poured out of the waterspout yonder , and flowed into the road .	The feeling with which I used to watch the tramps , as they came into the town on those wet evenings , at dusk , and limped past , with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of sticks , came freshly back to me ; fraught , as then , with the smell of damp earth , and wet leaves and briar , and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey .	The opening of the little door in the panneled wall made me start and turn .

How well I recollect the kind of day it was ! I smell the fog that hung about the place ; I see the hoar frost , ghostly , through it ; I feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek ; I look along the dim perspective of the school - room , with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning , and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers , and tap their feet upon the floor .

He was a dreadful old man to look at , in a filthy flannel waistcoat , and smelling terribly of rum .	His bedstead , covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork , was in the den he had come from , where another little window showed a prospect of more stinging - nettles , and a lame donkey .

I got some breakfast on the Heath , and walked back to Doctors ' Commons , along the watered roads and through a pleasan t smell of summer flowers , growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters ' heads , intent on this first effort to meet our altered circumstances .	I arrived at the office so soon , after all , that I had half an ' hour ' s loitering about the Commons , before old Tiffey , who was always first , appeared with his key .

Here , as I sat looking at the parcels , packages , and books , and inhaling the smell of stables ( ever since associated with that morning ) , a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through my mind .	Supposing nobody should ever fetch me , how long would they consent to keep me there ? Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ? Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins , with the other luggage , and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning ; or should I be turned out every night , and expected to come again to be left till called for , when the office opened next day ? Supposing there was no mistake in the case , and Mr .

The rest of the half - year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives ; of the waning summer and the changing season ; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed , and the cold , cold smell of tho dark nights when we were rung into bed ; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed , and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering - machine ; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef , and boiled mutton with roast mutton ; of clods of bread - and - butter , dog ' s - eared lessonbooks , lessonbooks , cracked slates , tear - blotted copy - books , canings , rulerings , hair - cuttings , rainy Sundays , suet puddings , and a dirty atmosphere of ink surrounding all .

As he advanced , the forest became larger , he found trees covered with blossoms blossoms which exhaled an unknown perfume ; it had nothing enervating in it like those of earth , but was , as it were a sort of moral emanation which embalmed the soul , it was strengthening and delicious at the same time , like the sight of a good action .	At length he perceived farther on a glade , radiant with a marvellous light ; he sat down to enjoy the prospect , and then suddenly suddenly the song of a bird overhead fell upon his ear — sounds so sweet as to defy description — gentler than the fall of oars upon a lake in summer , than the murmur of a breeze among weeping willows , or the sigh of a sleeping sleeping infant .

He saw himself once more in the Luxemburg garden at the close of a bright spring day ; the charm of the deepening twilight , the smell of the flowers , the dark blue sky seen through the spare foliage , and the marble statues of the queens — all these things had deeply impressed him as he walked with Rosalie , silent , by his side .

He had returned to the Rue Coetlogon a prey to that fever of hope which brings tears to one ' s eyes and moves one ' s nature to its inmost depths .

And as he listened the past returned to Rene more vividly than ever ; he was back in his peaceful room again , and felt once more the secret pleasure of rising each morning to resume his unfinished task .

In the close atmosphere of this room , impregnated with the perfume that Colette used , and before the almost immodest attitude of the pair before him , there came over him a feeling of sensuality with which he was already too familiar .	The sight of this depraved creature — though her depravity was generally clothed in graceful forms — had often awakened in him ideas of a physical passion very different from any he had hitherto known .

But the barriers of reserve gave way before this subtle perfume , perfume , which awakened memories of all that was least ideal in her rival — the golden ringlets in her neck , her ruby lips and pearly teeth , her snowy rounded shoulders shoulders and the long bare arms with their tapering wrists .	And this , too , just as he was attempting to attribute his admiration for her to intellectual motives .

But all that Rene knew of Society life he had learnt either from Balzac and other novelists of fifty years ago or from more modern authors who had never seen the inside of a drawing - room ; the ensemble G 2 A LIVING LIE 84 of this apartment , beautifully harmonised by the soft tints of the shaded lamp , was therefore to him like the revelation of a hidden trait peculiar to the woman who had presided over its arrangement .	The charm of the moment was the more irresistible since the Madonna who dwelt in this shrine , with its subdued light and its warm air heavy with the scent of flowers , received him with a smile and a look in her eyes that at once dispelled dispelled all his childish fears .

She cast a glance at the long mirror set in the centre of her wardrobe , where , packed away in sweet - smelling sachets , lay piles of embroidered linen ; seeing how well she looked she smiled as there once more flashed across her brain the same idea that but a few moments ago had dragged her from her husband ' s arms .	This idea was evidently not one of those which it pleased her to entertain , for she shook her head , and a few minutes later , having thrown over her bare neck and shoulders a dressing - jacket of pale blue foulard silk and put her naked feet into a pair of soft swansdown swansdown slippers , she gave herself up to the hands of her maid , who began to dress the long , shining hair .

She took the letter , looked at the address as we do when trying to guess from whom a communication comes , tore it open and skimmed its contents , after having first cast a glance at the signature ; then , getting up to place it amongst some others on her desk , she said : ' Another begging letter !

Of what use would it have been to indulge , as Claude would have done , in a pessimistic analysis of this woman ' s character , except to conjure up thoughts of blackmail and other dangers , all entirely imaginary , as it happened ?

We have seen that the light oils — photogen and solar oil — of brown coal tar , which is obtained at a comparatively low7 temperature , although much richer in aromatic hydrocarbons than even the specifically heaviest petroleum , are in this respect far behind the light oils of stone - coal tar , which chiefly consist of aromatic hydrocarbons .	Now since stone - coal tar is obtained at a much higher temperature than brown coal tar , it follows that the formation formation of petroleum must have been effected at a still lower temperature than is required for the production of brown coal tar .

However , the lower the specific gravity of petroleum the poorer in aromatic hydrocarbons it has been found to be , and the lower it may be supposed the temperature of the formation must have been , if not , what is very likely possible , the concentration concentration of heavy hydrocarbons took place later on .

Very high temperatures were required for vaporization , and the oil - vapors coming in contact with the over - heated sides of the still suffered partial decomposition , with the formation of lighter hydrocarbons , hydrocarbons , which decreased the fatness of the oil and imparted to it a disagreeable odor .	To avoid these evils it was endeavored to destroy , or at least decrease the odor by the use of more chemicals , chemicals , and to convert the oil into a tolerably useful commercial article by the addition of vegetable and animal oils .

The oil thus retains its lubricating power , and there is no inducement for the formation of pyrogenous products with a bad odor .	The steam may be used either directly from the boiler as saturated steam with a pressure and temperature corresponding with those of the boiler , or as superheated steam .

The oils obtained were fatter and lighter , but not free from odor .	The principal reason for the latter defect was the use of upright stills , the distance the oil vapor had to ascend being disproportionately disproportionately large to the vaporizing surface .

The distillates obtained by cracking have unfortunately not yet been subjected to examination , but it would seem to be incorrect to consider them as consisting of the same hydrocarbons hydrocarbons as those obtained from crude petroleum , they being very likely richer in aromatic and non - saturated hydrocarbons .	The cracking process based upon decomposition with the assistance of hot iron may be explained by experiments of Letny , Ragosin and others .

The cracking still heated to a gentle red heat may be considered a large pipe in which the heavy oils suffer decomposition by coming in contact with it , and form , though not to the same extent as in the abovementioned abovementioned experiment , a considerable percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons .	That the hydrocarbons formed by the cracking cracking process have a different chemical composition from those occurring in crude oil is also proved by their behavior when subjected to treatment with sulphuric acid and lye .

The scheme had been promoted by Dalrymple , the Master of Stair , then in very evil odour for the massacre of Glencoe .

The lower part of the figure was hidden so that it seemed as if a woman ' s bust was gliding along over the orange - golden flowers , and Dave slackened his pace a little and watched the progress of the figure , just as the cow raised its head , saw the woman , outstretched its soft moist muzzle so that its dew - lap formed a curve , and gave vent to a musical low of welcome , for the hour had come when its mistress ' s approach was pleasant in the gentle beast ' s eyes .

Fair sirs , with your science , you put them to scorn ; But will ye make me the loom where the lily was spun ? Where its thread was blent when God said : ' ' Well done ! Will ye mix me the red of the rose at morn With perfume that hath lifted a heart forlorn To the throne of heaven ' s Highest and Holiest One ? That white Queen Blanche who was fair for an hour Is naught now but the scent of a delicate fame ; But slight not her beauty , my masters , nor shame The sheen and perfume of the morning flower When its bloom is a witness of high heaven ' s power And its scent gives glory to God ' s great name 1 THE GLORY OF THE GARDEN .	7 PANDORA .

Echoing far out to his remotest spheres ! Mother of sorrows , Mary of the Cross , Of Calvary ' s secrets still thy sons are fain !

Much of the art of Horatian verse consists of skilfully disguised line rhymes which are often used to rest the voice after a series of stave rhymes , as in the third verse above where the melodious antithesis antithesis between and defines the verse of which it is a part and checks the voice for an interval of melody longer than that generally punctuated by the period .

We cannot say much in favour of the pigs : they are voted a nuisance , and seem to be conscious that they are not in good odour ; but they are learned in their way , and know the map of Westminster as well as the postman .	They invade Petty France , which is not half - a - mile off , every morning , and amidst the ineffable filth of that indescribably filthy district they growl and grunt and snuffle through the livelong day .

Surrounded by crowded streets , dark narrow lanes , and fetid courts , and in the very midst of the district ( its principal boundaries may be roughly stated as parts of Artillery Row , Coburg Row , St .	Margaret ' s Place , Francis Street , Brewer ' s Green , and James Street ) it was thus described by a writer five and thirty years ago .

They had formed the Library of the two great scholars , father and son , who had successively conducted the Academy .

It is narrow and squalid : the houses are mean and dirty : the shops are those which belong to a very poor quarter : and there is continually , day and night , floating on the air , a thick , invisible cloud of smell .	I know not how high it rises overhead , but at the elevation of five feet seven , where Laurence first struck it , the smeU was as strong as Alcides , and as penetrating as the dart of Cupid .

Laurence gasped , choked , and rushed through this bank of fragrance before he rephed .	' Yes — yes — they have all quite vanished , I assure you .
bl08111	smell		very odd								' Yes — yes — they have all quite vanished , I assure you .	At that moment — when you spoke — there were , it is true , a few ghosts — mere shadows — of houses : and there seemed — perhaps my fancy — to be the faint ghost of a smell — very odd thing : I never met , before , with the ghost of a smeU — fried fish it was — fish fried in oil — fish not quite fresh dipped in oil rather turned and then imperfectly fried — a very odd ghost .	' Althea listened with some impatience .

Nothing now but gardens and hedges and wUd flowers and the — the — oh ! Lord ! that fried fish ! — the sweetest fragrance from the wild roses and the honeysuckle .	It is a balmy air .
bl08111	fragrance		subtle								Upon the great Cathedral steps I stood Alone amid the mighty throng — * FLEET STREET REVISITED 215 ' I wonder the Saturday Review faUed to remark those lines .	To me they have always seemed to possess a certain delicacy of sentiment — eh ? — a subtle fragrance — the thought is suggested — only those of Uke mind would catch it — there is a whisper in it — a murmur of midnight — something ethereal caught from the moon riding in the heavens and the jewelled sky .	' ' I remember them very weU , ' said Althea .

And though cold mutton formed the staple of the meal , there were flowers fetched from the neighbouring neighbouring market — the Covent Garden of the Borough : there were plums and pears for dessert also from that hospitable emporium emporium : there was a most deUcate confection of apples and cream made by Asthea ' s own hands : and though plain beer — that at eight and six the nine - gaUon cask — formed the daUy beverage of her father and her uncle , there was placed upon the table a square bottle the fragrance of which was alone sufficient to diffuse happiness .	Laurence also remarked — Cassie being another guest — that both the girls had put on theh best things .

No , Cassie was sitting by herself , her head in her hands , abandoned to melancholy reflections and the natural flatness of things after a day of festivity .

The room was furnished with a sofa , an easy chair , and three or four ordinary chairs ; a large Bible lay open on the table : heavy curtains hung across the window and the door : there was a fire in the grate though the evening was not cold : and Sister Claudia sat in the easy chair beside it .

Now , the village among the tall , straight date - palms , with their scaled trunks , begins to grow misty with the rising smoke of the fires , and the odour of fried onions is on the breeze .	The goats and kids , and cocks and hens , climbing about on the thatch or walls of the houses , protest against the smoke after the manner of their kind , but no one heeds them , for the talk down below concerning the cooking ofthe supper is animated .

This last sample of its futility was too much , and just pat in conjunction conjunction with it came its reductio ad absurdum .

' ' As I never did before , or ever can love any girl again ! ' He pressed her closer to him , and kissed her brow , her hair , her eyes , and cheeks , again and again .	At that moment there was a sound close by , a sound as of dry twigs cracking , and then the odour of a cigar was wasted through the dense and leafy screen of shrubbery and underwood that grew round the stems of the trees that overhung their meeting - place beside the river .	' Who the deuce ? ' muttered Lonsdale angrily ; but the LOVE ' S LABOUR WON .

The summer gloaming was deepening in its golden light and purple shadows ; the roses in the garden loaded the air with perfume ; the elms and beeches that grew thereby tossed their branches in the soft breeze of the mist , and long ferns waved their fronds to and fro , and the hour seemed full of whispers , as Amy rose , and in some haste , to take her departure for home — knowing who would meet her on the way .	' Oh , it cannot be , it must not be , that you love me more than a friend — more than a brother ! ' wailed the girl , in her kind heart , as she withdrew ; ' poor fellow — poor darling Reggie — that would be too terrible ! ' To Reginald it soon became apparent that Musgrave ' s visits to the Vicarage became more frequent and protracted , and that there was no necessity for visiting Rose Cottage if he sought to see Amy .

But fancy it was not ; someone had been there — an eavesdroppe eavesdroppe — for , soon after , Lonsdale ' s quick eye detected a half - smoked cigar , as if tossed away in haste , still smouldering smouldering among the long grass , and he thought that he recognised recognised the aroma and the brand thereof .	The circumstance , however , was soon dismissed from their minds , full as the latter were of a subject nearer and dearer .

What would be thought — what said of her ? She was neither wife nor widow ! How to face the world — society — that brutal , selfish , and unreasoning unreasoning bugbear ? She was cut off from both for ever now .	While Digby was telegraphing to his solicitor at Lincoln ' s Inn Fields , Claire , rising from the bed on which she had thrown herself without undressing , and where she had lain in speechless misery , bathed her throbbing temples with scented vinegar , gathered together a few jewels that were strictly her own , put a certain sum in her purse , clothed herself in a dark and plain costume , and with a few necessary necessary articles in a handbag , stole away from the scene of her past happiness ; and pausing only to take a tear - blurred and brief farewell glance at the cottage , embosomed amid its fragrant orchards , she went forth into the darkness of the early morning ; and when Digby returned , all trace of her was lost , and he never saw her face again .	After a long and painful search , after putting the telegraph to work in every direction , after writing and advertising till his heart grew sick and sore with direst apprehension , after all manner of wild ideas about the waterfalls , torrents , and cascades that abound in the vicinity of Lynmouth , he had to give up all hope of unravelling the mystery that covered the flight or fate of Claite .
bl08113	odour	of stephanotis|mignonette|roses|under the dewy elm		Through the open window		from the cottage garden					33 Amy sat amid the gloaming ( as the Scots call the after - glow of eve ) playing chess in the recess of a window — he rather affecting to do so , being wholly intent on the sweet , soft face and downcast looks of his companion , and the lingering motions of her slim little hands , for already the twilight had so deepened that they , in their whiteness , were more visible than were the ivory pieces , the position of which it was almost difficult to discern .	Through the open window came the odour of stephanotis , mignonette , and roses from the cottage garden , under the dewy elm branches .	And ere long Reginald Talbot crept off to bed , happy and radiant , with a rose - bud Amy had given him from the bouquet at her bosom , to treasure carefully carefully in a glass near his pillow , as a relic her hand had touched ; and with her soft good - night to mingle with his dreams , if he had any , which was pretty often the case with this helpless lover now .

And when the dog , chilled with rain , shivered and whined , Dick thought vangefully of his aunt Chillington ' s pet poodle , which slept in a mother - of - pearl basket , that was lined with blue satin , stuffed with down , and had scented pockets round it ; and which dined off macaroons and cream , or chicken and meat , minced by the hands of his pampered mistress , or her odious French maid , Clochette .	At last Dick slept , and so passed the first night after he ran away from ' home .
